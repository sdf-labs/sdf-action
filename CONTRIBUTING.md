Thank you for your interest in contributing to sdf-action! We welcome contributions from the community and are excited to see what you can bring to the project. Before you get started, please review the guidelines below to ensure a smooth and efficient contribution process.

## PR Labeling Guidelines
When opening a pull request, please ensure that you apply the appropriate labels to your PR based on the type of changes being introduced. This helps us to categorize and prioritize the review and merging process. Below are the guidelines for labeling pull requests:

> Note: PRs labeled with `breaking`, `enhancement`, `fix`, or `release` will trigger a new release automatically when merged.

### Major Changes
Labels: `breaking`

Apply the `breaking` label to your pull request if it contains significant changes that require attention from all stakeholders. These changes may include breaking API changes, major feature additions, or architectural modifications.

### Minor Changes
Labels: `enhancement`, `fix`

Apply the `enhancement` label to your pull request if it includes new features, improvements, or enhancements that enhance existing functionality. Apply the `fix` label if your pull request addresses bugs or defects.

### Patch Changes
Labels: `documentation`, `maintenance`, `patch`

Apply the `documentation` label to your pull request if it includes changes related to documentation, such as updating `README` file, or improving inline code comments. Apply the `maintenance` label to your pull request if it includes minor changes, optimizations, or housekeeping tasks that do not fall into the above categories. If your pull request does not fit into any of the above categories, apply the `patch` label by default.

> Note: Please ensure that you apply only one label per category. If you believe your changes fit into multiple categories, choose the label that best represents the primary focus of your pull request. If you're unsure about which label to apply, feel free to reach out to maintainers or reviewers for guidance.
