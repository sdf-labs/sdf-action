## PR Labeling Guidelines

When opening a pull request, please ensure that you apply the appropriate labels to your PR based on the type of changes being introduced. This helps us to categorize and prioritize the review and merging process. Below are the guidelines for labeling pull requests:

> Note: PRs labeled with `breaking`, `enhancement`, `fix`, or `release` will trigger a new release automatically when merged.

### Major Changes
Labels: `breaking`

### Minor Changes
Labels: `enhancement`, `fix`

### Patch Changes
Labels: `documentation`, `maintenance`, `patch`

> Note: Please ensure that you apply only one label per category. If you believe your changes fit into multiple categories, choose the label that best represents the primary focus of your pull request. If you're unsure about which label to apply, feel free to reach out to maintainers or reviewers for guidance.
